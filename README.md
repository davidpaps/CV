## David Papamichael

I am a fresh graduate of the [*Makers Academy*](https://makers.tech/) developer bootcamp. I’m looking for a junior developer role which will allow me to consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, and expose me to the working life of a developer team in production. My time at Makers have given me a deep understanding into the fundamentals of software development, great coding principals and practises, all of which I am keen to implement in a professional environment based in the tech scene of London.

I was looking for a new challenge after 7 years working in the medical field, becoming a developer felt like the logical progression for what I wanted out of my career. I have a history of proven problem solving, spending the last 4 years dealing with  chronic back pain patients, assessing their spinal medical images (MRI’s, CT’s, EOS ect) and recommending the appropriate treatment options, ranging from physiotherapy, to surgery.

I soon realised that the fascinating parts of my job revolved around problem solving, and finding out what was wrong with the patient sitting in front of me. I loved my previous role, but was looking for something that involved more of that on the spot problem solving and analytical thinking.

## Projects


| Project  | Description | Tech Used |
|---|---|---|
| [*Facebook Clone*](https://acebook-u-jakd.herokuapp.com/) | 'Acebook', a 2 week project, a clone of facebook that allows a user to register, log in and create posts, comments and likes on their own/and other users posts. Also has a live chat implementation.| Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, RSpec, Capybara   |
| [*Air BnB Clone*](https://github.com/shadz22/MakersBnB)  | 'B and Breakfast', a 1 week project, a clone of Air Bnb made into a Single Page JavaScript App. Users can sign up, make a post, browse other listings and communicate through the interface to book. | Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Sinatra, Ruby, Jasmine, Rspec, Capybara   |
| [*Pong!*](http://net-positive.herokuapp.com/) | My 2 week final project that involved building a neural network that leaned to play the classic video game pong. A user could then play against this AI, or against another player in the online arcade.| Javascript, JQuery, Python, Django, CSS, HTML, Jasmine, Pytest|

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Experience

**The Harley Street Spine Clinic** (July 2014 - August 2019)   
*Clinical Manager*  
- I interpreted spinal medical imaging to patients, face to face, and discussed treatment options based on the results. Dealing with people in pain, and from all ages and walks of life, helped me to hone my empathy skills, and interact in a sensitive but constructive way whilst enforcing a trust bond with the patients.

**Spine Plus** (July 2012 - June 2014)    
*Spinal Decompression Technician*  
- This role exposed me to a variety of people from all walks of life, and equipped me with the skills necessary to converse, strategise and find solutions for their ongoing back pain.



## Hobbies

- __Rock Climbing__, my other problem solving based passion in life. I believe this hobby/way of life, makes me a better programmer, for rock climbing is the physical equivalent of coding - how to get past an obstacle in the smartest and most efficient way possible.

- __Travelling__,I love to explore the world, discover new cultures and ways of life, it also goes perfectly with Rock climbing!
